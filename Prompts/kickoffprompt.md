    - Read the Product Requirements Document (PRD) for the project.
2. **Analyze and break down the PRD**:
    - Identify the business and technical requirements.
    - Decompose the PRD into clear, actionable Minimum Viable Product (MVP) features and supporting capabilities.
3. **Prioritize and structure the plan**:
    - Organize MVP features into a logical, incremental development roadmap.
    - Identify dependencies and optimal sequencing for rapid validation and iterative delivery.
4. **Document and explain**:

        - Executive summary (business value and goals)
        - MVP features list (with descriptions and value statements)
        - Prioritized feature/development roadmap
        - Key risks and mitigation strategies
        - Initial architecture considerations (highlighting agent roles, tools, and workflow components)

**Guidelines:**

- Reference all ServiceNow and project-specific standards to ensure compliant, maintainable, and scalable outcomes.
- Emphasize modularity, testability, and human-in-the-loop controls.
- Highlight opportunities for chain-of-thought reasoning, multi-agent collaboration, and escalation/supervision points.
- Ensure all deliverables align to measurable business outcomes defined in the PRD.

**Kickoff Instructions for the Agent:**

- Confirm that you have read and understood all instructions, documentation, and the PRD.

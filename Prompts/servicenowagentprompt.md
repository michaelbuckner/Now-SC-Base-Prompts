#### B. Agent Team Composition

- **Orchestrator Agent**:
    - Role: Planning, coordination, decision routing
    - Tools: Flow actions, decision logic, agent communication
    - Instructions: Strategic reasoning and workflow management
- **Worker Agent(s)**:
    - Role: Specialized task execution
    - Tools: Domain-specific skills, retrievers, integrations
    - Instructions: Tactical execution and result delivery
- **Communicator Agent**:
    - Role: Human interaction and transparency
    - Tools: Now Assist Panel, notification systems
    - Instructions: User communication and feedback collection


#### C. Tool Integration Strategy

- **RAG Implementation**: Use retrievers for knowledge grounding
- **Data Processing**: Scripts for complex data manipulation
- **External Integration**: Integration Hub for system connectivity
- **Workflow Automation**: Flows and subflows for process orchestration


### 3. Prompt Engineering Best Practices

#### Agent Instruction Design

```
Use this template for agent prompts:

ROLE: [Define agent's specific responsibility]
CONTEXT: [Provide relevant background and constraints]
TOOLS AVAILABLE: [List assigned tools and capabilities]
DECISION FRAMEWORK: [Reasoning patterns and decision criteria]
SUCCESS CRITERIA: [Clear outcomes and quality measures]
ESCALATION RULES: [When to involve humans or other agents]
```


#### Conversation Management

- Implement **multi-turn conversations** with context preservation
- Use **step-by-step plan presentation** for transparency
- Apply **confirmation patterns** for critical actions
- Design **graceful error handling** and recovery paths


### 4. Governance \& Security Implementation

#### Responsible AI Standards

- Implement **data masking** for PII protection using Sensitive Data Handler
- Configure **Now Assist Guardian** for content filtering and risk mitigation
- Establish **access controls** and role-based permissions
- Enable **audit logging** for all agent actions and decisions


#### Compliance Framework

- Follow **ServiceNow Responsible AI** guidelines
- Implement **bias detection and mitigation** strategies
- Ensure **explainable AI** with clear reasoning documentation
- Maintain **human oversight** for critical business decisions


### 5. Development \& Deployment Process

#### Testing Strategy

- Use **Now Assist Data Kit** for bulk testing and evaluation
- Implement **ATF (Automated Test Framework)** for regression testing
- Conduct **User Acceptance Testing** with real scenarios
- Monitor **performance metrics** and token usage optimization


#### Deployment Methodology
- **Phased rollout**: Start with pilot users, expand gradually
- **Performance monitoring**: Track latency, accuracy, and user satisfaction
- **Continuous improvement**: Iterate based on feedback and metrics
- **Version control**: Maintain prompt and workflow versioning


## Code \& Configuration Standards

### Naming Conventions
- **Agents**: `[Business Unit]_[Function]_Agent` (e.g., `ITSM_Incident_Resolution_Agent`)
- **Workflows**: `[Process]_Agentic_Workflow` (e.g., `Password_Reset_Agentic_Workflow`)
- **Skills**: `[Domain]_[Action]_Skill` (e.g., `Knowledge_Retrieval_Skill`)
- **Flows**: `[Agent]_[Action]_Flow` (e.g., `Incident_Agent_Analysis_Flow`)


### Scoping \& Organization
- Create **scoped applications** for modular development
- Use **meaningful namespaces** to avoid conflicts
- Organize related components in **logical application structures**
- Document **dependencies and integration points**


### Performance Optimization
